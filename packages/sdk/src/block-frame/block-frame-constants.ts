 *   (b) write host vault content             — same; plus no `brainstorm`
 *                                              global ever reaches the inner
 *                                              window (the SDK lives on the
 *                                              host side only)
 *   (c) escape iframe to host renderer       — opaque origin (no
 *                                              allow-same-origin) blocks
 *                                              cross-document access
 *   (d) reach sibling block iframe           — opaque origin + each frame is
 *                                              its own browsing context with

 *   • `script-src 'unsafe-inline'` — BP block code is inlined into the
 *     srcdoc by 9.5.2; the sandbox + opaque origin contains the blast
 *     radius, so 'unsafe-inline' is bounded. NO `'self'`, NO host
 *     allowlist — the block ships its script inline or doesn't run.
 *   • `style-src 'unsafe-inline'` — same rationale; BP blocks style
 *     themselves inline.
 *   • `connect-src 'none'` — no fetch / XHR / WebSocket / EventSource /
 *     beacon. Blocks cannot exfiltrate.
 *   • `img-src data:` — only inline data-URI images. No remote pixels.
 *   • `font-src 'none'`, `media-src 'none'`, `object-src 'none'`,
 *     `child-src 'none'`, `frame-src 'none'`, `worker-src 'none'`,
 *     `manifest-src 'none'`, `prefetch-src 'none'` — closed by default.
 *   • `form-action 'none'` — no form submission targets (sandbox already
 *     blocks via no allow-forms; defence-in-depth at the doc level).
 *
 * `frame-ancestors` is **deliberately absent** from this list. Two reasons,
 * both load-bearing for 9.5.2: (1) the directive cannot be enforced via
 * `<meta http-equiv>` per the CSP3 spec — browsers ignore it from a meta
 * tag (only the HTTP response header form takes effect). (2) Even if it
 * could, an opaque-origin srcdoc cannot match its embedder by origin —
 * `'self'` would not satisfy (the srcdoc's own origin is the opaque
 * `"null"`), `'none'` would self-block. The only meaningful frame-ancestors
 * enforcement here would come via the Chromium-only `<iframe csp=...>`
 * attribute or by serving the doc with a real HTTP CSP header; both
 * deferred. The sandbox attribute (no allow-top-navigation*, no
 * allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox) already prevents the abuse this directive
 * targets.
 *   • `base-uri 'none'` — `<base href>` in the inner doc cannot change
 *     relative URL resolution.
 *   • `navigate-to 'none'` — blocks document-level navigation requests
 *     (the directive was removed from the CSP3 draft and is not shipped by
 *     any current browser; kept as an aspirational hardening that costs
 *     nothing today and may become real later).
 *
 * Both the outer array AND every inner tuple are deep-frozen so a consumer
 * (e.g. 9.5.3's pentest iterating the directive list) cannot mutate any
 * entry at runtime to widen the policy. `'unsafe-inline'` for script/style
 * is the only widened directive; the opaque-origin sandbox + the explicit
 * `connect-src 'none'` together bound its blast radius (no exfil path, no
 * cross-origin read).
