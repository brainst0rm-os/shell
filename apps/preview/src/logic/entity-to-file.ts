/**
 * `entityToPreviewFile(entity)` — the missing link between a bare
 * `intent.open` / `quick-look` and a renderable surface.
 *
 * The shell's only *guaranteed* delivery on a fresh Preview launch is the
 * handshake `LaunchContext = { reason: "open-entity", entityId }` — no
 * MIME, no URL, no sibling list (those ride the `app:intent` push, which
 * the bus only fires when Preview was *already* running). So with just an
 * id, Preview must resolve the file itself: it holds `entities.read:*`
 * and calls `entities.get(id)`, then this pure function turns the row
 * into the `PreviewFile` the host already knows how to mount.
 *
 * A `brainstorm/File/v1` row from the Files app carries `{ name, mime,
 * size, assetId, assetMime }` — its bytes live in the shell asset store,
 * served at `brainstorm://asset/<assetId>`. Other producers may instead
 * carry a ready `attachment` URL. Either way the URL survives the bridge
 * (bytes never cross structured clone); a row with no usable URL or MIME
 * resolves to `null` and the host shows its honest "no preview" pane
 * rather than a broken surface.
 *
 * Kept DOM-free + framework-free so the resolution branch is unit-tested
 * without a renderer or a live bridge.
